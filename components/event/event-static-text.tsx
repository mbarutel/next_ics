        In Australia, the protocol is to recognise the Traditional Owners of the

        with an acknowledgement to country and to local Traditional Elders: “We
        wish to acknowledge and respect the traditional custodians whose
        ancestral lands we are to meet upon. We acknowledge the deep feelings of
        attachment and relationship of Aboriginal peoples to Country. We also

        This conference presents a unique opportunity for delegates to
        participate in a positive environment that is dedicated to the sharing
        of information and the empowering of all who attend. In our everyday
        working environment the day to day stresses of our positions tends to
        limit us in expanding our knowledge and networking. Whether you work at
        a community level or at governmental level the opportunity to network
        and gain contacts outside of your local region tend to be limited, this
        is why this conference will be so valuable to participants. Hence, all
        Indigenous people and non-indigenous people whether professional or
        community-based, who have a vested interest in juvenile justice are
        invited.
