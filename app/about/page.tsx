//         Our Purpose
//       </h2>
//       <p>
//         We believe education is the key to generational change and a
//         brighter future, and we are deeply committed to the ongoing
//         success of Indigenous independence through private enterprise and
//         the fostering and nurturing of partnerships. Through developing
//         partnerships with community organizations, ICS funds conferences
//         without sourcing funding from government departments and
//         organizations. This enables community groups the opportunity to
//         stage a conference or event without 'going cup in hand' seeking
//         funding. A further benefit of an ICS funded event is the freedom
//         to place on the event agenda specific issues prevalent to the
//         partnered organization. All ICS events are what is termed public
//         interest and have deep grounding with grassroots principles.

//         Our Values
//       </h2>
//       <p>
//         Our Koori CEO, Tom Callaghan comes from Kempsey in Dunghutti
//         country of NSW. We specialize in working with NGOs and governments
//         and initiated several successful events over the years. Our events
//         are designed to be an information sharing platform for not only
//         open and frank discussion but also based upon the principles of
//         Indigenous self-determination through the sharing of positive
//         information, programs and cooperation between community
//         organizations and governments. Moreover, if a national association
//         is not funded to run an event, we will lend our support and
//         expertise to help develop the conference. Our business model is
//         successful and well-proven; hence, ICS continues to save
//         organization's money, time and resources. The ICS business model
//         has work both nationally and internationally for many years no.
//         Fundamental to this is remaining neutral and outside political
//         agendas and without fear of losing funding.
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         We do not enter into government politics, nor were wishing to
//         develop a profile that will interfere or cut across any community
//         groupâ€™s philosophy or beliefs. Our sole aim is to bring together
//         information that can be disseminated for the better good of
//         Indigenous communities. It is our plan to be recognized as a
//         network sharing tools and a provider of quality conferences and
//         seminars that enhances local and government organization with
//         quality speakers and training programs.
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         Our conferences are not political based rather should be seen as
//         an opportunity to access information that is not readily available
//         at your own level. Today, the world has become smaller with the
//         invention of the internet however the internet has also managed to
//         sterilised and isolate people at the same time. As such, we are of
//         the belief that there is nothing more empowering and more
//         efficient than for workers to have an opportunity to network and
//         meet face to face to exchange ideas, valuable information and
//         successful programs in place in their communities.
